[2025-12-04 13:48] Initial arXiv API population - Successfully fetched first papers
File: devlog/2512041348.txt

== What we worked on ==
- Initial database population with papers from arXiv API
- Triggered the daily papers cron job for the first time
- Fetched papers for all 5 configured fields in the database

== Changes made ==
- node_modules/: Installed npm dependencies (385 packages)
- Database: Populated papers, daily_papers, paper_summaries, and paper_quizzes tables
- Server: Started Next.js dev server on port 3001 (port 3000 was in use)

== Problems encountered ==
- Problem 1: npm dependencies were not installed
  - Symptom: "sh: next: command not found" when running npm run dev
- Problem 2: Port 3000 was already in use
  - Symptom: Next.js automatically used port 3001 instead

== How we tried to solve it ==
- Attempt 1: Ran npm run dev without dependencies installed (failed)
- Attempt 2: Ran npm install to install all dependencies
- Attempt 3: Restarted dev server, which automatically detected port conflict

== How we solved it / Current status ==
- Problem 1 solved: Ran `npm install` which installed 385 packages successfully
- Problem 2 solved: Next.js automatically used available port 3001
- Cron job executed successfully:
  - Made POST request to http://localhost:3001/api/cron/daily-papers
  - Used x-cron-secret header for authentication
  - Passed date parameter: 2025-12-04
  - Results: Processed 5 fields, all successful (0 failures)

== Cron execution results ==
Fields processed successfully:
- ai-ml (AI & Machine Learning)
- astrophysics
- computer-science
- mathematics
- statistics

For each field, the cron job:
1. Fetched papers from arXiv API using field-specific queries
2. Filtered out previously used papers
3. Selected the newest available paper
4. Generated summaries at 3 reading levels (grade5, middle, high)
5. Generated a quiz with 5 questions
6. Saved all data to Supabase database

Total execution time: ~2 minutes 17 seconds
Rate limiting: Respected arXiv's 3-second delay between requests

== Current status ==
- Database successfully populated with initial papers for 2025-12-04
- User manually confirmed data is visible in Supabase
- Dev server running on http://localhost:3001
- All environment variables properly configured (.env.local)

== Next steps / TODOs ==
- Set up automated cron job scheduling (e.g., Vercel Cron or external scheduler)
- Test the frontend to view the populated papers
- Consider adding error handling/retry logic for failed API calls
- Monitor OpenAI API usage for summary/quiz generation costs
